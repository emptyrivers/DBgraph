Welcome to ProductionChain!

This is a QoL mod for Factorio, inspired by mods such as FNEI, What is it Used For? and Helmod, with a heavy focus on user experience.

Features:

* Automatically finds recipe chains that optimize for resource efficiency, power cost, or UPS cost. 
* Find the best use for any item at your current tech level, without any fussy UI digging.
* ProductionChain does as much work as it can before you make a query, to minimize performance impact, and uses a flexible tick spreading facility to ensure that there is no noticeable frame stutter.
* Compatible with any combination of mods.

Should you have any questions, you can find me on the Factorio Discord Server (link [here](https://discord.gg/E4hCmPs)), as the user @emptyrivers#8800. If you have a bug report, open a ticket [here](https://github.com/emptyrivers/ProductionChain/issues/new).
