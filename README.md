Welcome to ProductionChain!

This is a QoL mod for Factorio, inspired by mods such as FNEI, What is it Used For? and Helmod, with a heavy focus on user experience.

Features:

* Find the best method to produce any item or ratio of items.
* Find the best use for any item at your current tech level, without any fussy UI digging.
* ProductionChain does as much work as it can before you make a query, to minimize performance impact, and uses a flexible tick spreading facility to ensure that there is no noticeable frame stutter.
* Compatible with almost any combination of mods. *Note: ProductionChain assumes that you are capable of eventually producing everything, starting with only what you can acquire with bare hands. It is possible that another mod might violate this assumption, in which case ProductionChain may not give accurate solutions. A remote interface is available for external mods to add additional data to solve this problem, but the responsibility to resolve this issue lies on the mod which violated the assumption in the first place.*

Should you have any questions, you can find me on the Factorio Discord Server (link [here](https://discord.gg/E4hCmPs)), as the user @emptyrivers#8800. If you have a bug report or feature request, open a ticket [here](https://github.com/emptyrivers/ProductionChain/issues/new). Please note that I do not pay attention to any other channels, so if you ask a question on the factorio or the discussion threads on mods.factorio.com, I am very unlikely to see it.
